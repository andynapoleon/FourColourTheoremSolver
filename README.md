# 🗺️ Four-Color Map Theorem Solver 🎨

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Four-Color Map Theorem Solver! This exciting project brings the fascinating world of graph theory and cartography right to your browser. Ever wondered how maps are colored using just four colors without any adjacent regions sharing the same color? Well, you're in for a treat! 🤩

## 🚀 Features

- 🖌️ Interactive map coloring interface
- 🧠 Intelligent back-tracking algorithm used to solve the Four-Color Theorem
- 🔒 Secure user authentication

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js with Next.js framework
- Backend: Go (Golang), Flask (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
