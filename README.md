# 🗺️ Four-Color Map Theorem Solver 🎨

## 🌟 Summary

Welcome to the Four-Color Map Theorem Solver, an interactive web application demonstrating one of mathematics' most significant theorems in graph theory and topology. This tool provides a practical implementation of the Four-Color Theorem, which states that any planar map can be colored using no more than four colors while ensuring no adjacent regions share the same color.

The Four-Color Theorem, first proposed in 1852 and proven in 1976, represents a landmark achievement in mathematical history, being the first major theorem to be proved using computer assistance. This application brings this complex mathematical concept to life through an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

Initially developed collaboratively during the **DevelopEd 2.0 Hackathon (2023)** 🏆 and further advanced 🚀. Our implementation allows users to:
- Create custom maps through an interactive canvas
- Automatically generate mathematically valid four-color solutions
- Save and download colored maps
- Visualize the theorem's practical applications

This project serves as both an educational tool and a practical utility, making complex mathematical concepts accessible to students, educators, and enthusiasts alike.
